# Introduction

This is a simple static web page that converts the 
files used by various Magic: The Gathering collection 
trackers to other formats.

I made this driven by my personal needs, so the only feature 
available right now is the conversion from a CardTrader 
`.xls` to a Moxfield `.csv`.

# Features

## CardTrader to Moxfield
With the application you can convert a CardTrader `.xls` 
file (like the one you can download in your order details) 
to a Moxfield `.csv`.

This way, everytime you order some cards on CardTrader, you 
can easily import the list of your new cards into your 
Moxfield collection with a single import.

# Usage
1. Access the application using this link: https://silvanohu.github.io/mtg-csv-converter/
2. Upload the Excel file
3. Convert the contents to CSV
4. Download the CSV using the link at the bottom of the page
